Playground | [badassdon](http://www.badassdon.com)
==================================================

For experiments, hackathons, and various smaller projects.

This is where all young experiments go before they grow up and deserve their own repo. Each subdirectory has its own README.md description, so click on them to learn more. 


### Showcase

* [Canvas Image Filters](http://www.hackyon.com/playground/filters) - JavaScript implementations of image filters (Hue, Saturation, Contrast, etc.) by manipulating pixel data on a HTML5 canvas. Planning to port this project as a polyfill for [CSS3 filters](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/filters/understanding-css).
* [CSS Inliner](http://github.com/badassdon/playground/tree/master/inliner) - Inlines CSS styles from the stylesheets into their DOM elements using Phantom.js. The most obvious use case is sending HTML emails (because email clients tend to remove all the non-inline styles).
* [jQuery-Slideshow](http://www.hackyon.com/playground/slideshow) - A jQuery plugin for an image slideshow. Experimenting with the cool transition effects I have seen in similar slideshows libraries.
* [Basic Homing Missiles](http://www.hackyon.com/playground/missile) - Experimented with a very basic implementation of homing missiles, but ended up with something pretty fun to look at after playing around with the design. Requires efficient SVG and so is best viewed on WebKit browsers.
